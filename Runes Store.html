			<div class="Ab">Do you like Cheese Whiz? Spray tan? Fake eyelashes? That's what is Lorem Ipsum to many—it
				rubs them the wrong way, all the way. It's unreal, uncanny, makes you wonder if something is wrong, it
				seems to seek your attention for all the wrong reasons. Usually, we prefer the real thing, wine without
				sulfur based preservatives, real butter, not margarine, and so we'd like our layouts and designs to be
				filled with real words, with thoughts that count, information that has value.</div>
			<div class="Ab">Rune stones, (sometimes cards), are used as tools of divination - a way to predict one's
				future. Rune Stones come in a set of 24 ancient alphabetic symbols. They can be made of different
				materials - wood or glass most common and attractive - and usually kept in a pouch or box. They usually
				come with a book of instructions defining the symbols.

				Ideally ruins are cast on an East-West axis or facing the sun. A white cloth is laid down and used to
				determine the direction of the casting. From here the focus should lie with the pressing question. After
				casting the stones onto the cloth the ones which have fallen the right side up are read and depending
				upon whether the rune is reversed or not will have a bearing upon its meaning and the reading as a
				whole.

				An alternative to casting the rune stones ...

				Pick a rune stone randomly for a day reading; you can also do what is known as a 3 rune spread. Some
				feel that the day rune is a good way to get an answer to a single question. The 3 Rune Spread is used
				for asking broader questions whereas the single rune can be drawn on a daily basis.

				Meanings and interpretations of each rune stone are shown below.</div>
			<div class="Ab">There is some evidence that, in addition to being a writing system, runes historically
				served purposes of magic. This is the case from earliest epigraphic evidence of the Roman to Germanic
				Iron Age, with non-linguistic inscriptions and the alu word. An erilaz appears to have been a person
				versed in runes, including their magic applications.

				In medieval sources, notably the Poetic Edda, the Sigrdrifumal mentions "victory runes" to be carved on
				a sword, "some on the grasp and some on the inlay, and name Tyr twice."

				In early and more modern times, related folklore and superstition is recorded in the form of the
				Icelandic magical staves.

				In the early 20th century, Germanic mysticism coins new forms of "runic magic", some of which were
				continued or developed further by contemporary adherents of Germanic Neopaganism.

				Runes have been used in Nazi symbolism by National Socialists and neo-Nazi groups that associate
				themselves with Germanic traditions, mainly the Sigel, Eihwaz, Tyr, Odal (see Odalism) and Algiz runes.
				The fascination that runes seem to have exerted on the Nazis can be traced to the occult and volkisch
				author Guido von List, one of the important figures in Germanic mysticism and runic revivalism in the
				late 19th and early 20th century. In 1908, List published in Das Geheimnis der Runen ("The Secret of the
				Runes") a set of 18 so-called "Armanen Runes", based on the Younger Futhark, which were allegedly
				revealed to him in a state of temporary blindness after a cataract operation on both eyes in 1902. In
				Nazi contexts, the s-rune is referred to as "Sig" (after List, probably from Anglo-Saxon Sigel). The
				"Wolfsangel", while not a rune historically, has the shape of List's "Gibor" rune.</div>
